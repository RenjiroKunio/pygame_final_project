# Pygame Final Project

## Project Overview

This project is a 2D arcade-style space shooter game developed using Python and the Pygame library.  
The player controls a spaceship and must survive against continuously spawning enemies while tracking score and health status.

The application demonstrates the use of:
- Object-oriented programming with multiple custom classes
- Modular program structure across multiple Python files
- Sprite-based game mechanics using Pygame
- Collision handling, scoring, and health management
- External assets such as images and sound effects

The project was created as a final project for **COMP6047001 – Algorithm and Programming**, with a focus on applying programming concepts, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
